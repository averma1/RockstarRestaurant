# RockstarRestaurant
Cool restaurant for COMP 345 project

Description:
This software has been created to make using the POS more effective and efficient to use. It allows for live time updating of current inventory. Servers will be able to enter food orders as well as drink orders. They will also be able to pay the bill when the customers are done. Chefs will be able to see the order, make it and update the current stock. Bartenders will be able to see the drink order, make it and update the current stock. Administrators can check transaction history to see how much money the restaurant brought it. They will also be able to add/remove items as well as editing their prices.

The intended users of this software would be for those who work at a restaurant (ie. servers, chefs, bartenders and upper management).

The motivation behind this software is to allow a faster more efficient system ultimately creating a better customer experience as well as generating more revenue for the restaurant.
